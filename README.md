##Dependencies##
**KnockoutJS**. That's it.


##Distributions##

The [latest/code](latest/code) folder contains the latest distributions of the valerie library.

The folder contains minified (`*.min.js`) and non-minified (`*.js`) versions of each distribution.

You'll only need to use **one** of the files in this folder in your project, typically you'll use
one of:

- **valerie-en.min.js**
- **valerie-en-gb.min.js**
- **valerie-en-us.min.js**

depending on which locale you need.
